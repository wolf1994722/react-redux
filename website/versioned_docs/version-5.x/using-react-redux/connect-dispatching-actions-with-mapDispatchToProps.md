# Connect: Dispatching Actions with `mapDispatchToProps`

As the second argument passed in to `connect`, `mapDispatchToProps` is used for dispatching actions to the store.

`dispatch` is a function of the Redux store. You call `store.dispatch` to dispatch an action.
This is the only way to trigger a state change.

With React-Redux, your components never access the store directly - `connect` does it for you.
React-Redux gives you two ways to let components dispatch actions:

- By default, a connected component receives `props.dispatch` and can dispatch actions itself.
- `connect` can accept an argument called `mapDispatchToProps`, which lets you create functions that dispatch when called, and pass those functions as props to your component.

The `mapDispatchToProps` functions are normally referred to as `mapDispatch` for short, but the actual variable name used can be whatever you want.

## Approaches for Dispatching

### Default: `dispatch` as a Prop

If you don't specify the second argument to `connect()`, your component will receive `dispatch` by default. For example:

```js
connect()(MyComponent);
// which is equivalent with
connect(
  null,
  null
)(MyComponent);

// or
connect(mapStateToProps /** no second argument */)(MyComponent);
```

Once you have connected your component in this way, your component receives `props.dispatch`. You may use it to dispatch actions to the store.

```js
function Counter({ count, dispatch }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })}>-</button>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "RESET" })}>reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Providing A `mapDispatchToProps` Parameter

Providing a `mapDispatchToProps` allows you to specify which actions your component might need to dispatch. It lets you provide action dispatching functions as props. Therefore, instead of calling `props.dispatch(() => increment())`, you may call `props.increment()` directly. There are a few reasons why you might want to do that.

#### More Declarative

First, encapsulating the dispatch logic into function makes the implementation more declarative.
Dispatching an action and letting the Redux store handle the data flow is _how to_ implement the behavior, rather than _what_ it does.

A good example would be dispatching an action when a button is clicked. Connecting the button directly probably doesn't make sense conceptually, and neither does having the button reference `dispatch`.

```js
// button needs to be aware of "dispatch"
<button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "SOMETHING" })} />

// button unaware of "dispatch",
<button onClick={doSomething} />
```

Once you've wrapped all our action creators with functions that dispatch the actions, the component is free of the need of `dispatch`.
Therefore, **if you define your own `mapDispatchToProps`, the connected component will no longer receive `dispatch`.**

#### Pass Down Action Dispatching Logic to ( Unconnected ) Child Components

In addition, you also gain the ability to pass down the action dispatching functions to child ( likely unconnected ) components.
This allows more components to dispatch actions, while keeping them "unaware" of Redux.

```jsx
// pass down toggleTodo to child component
// making Todo able to dispatch the toggleTodo action
const TodoList = ({ todos, toggleTodo }) => (
  <div>
    {todos.map(todo => (
      <Todo todo={todo} onClick={toggleTodo} />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

This is what React-Redux’s `connect` does — it encapsulates the logic of talking to the Redux store and lets you not worry about it. And this is what you should totally make full use of in your implementation.

## Two Forms of `mapDispatchToProps`

The `mapDispatchToProps` parameter can be of two forms. While the function form allows more customization, the object form is easy to use.

- **Function form**: Allows more customization, gains access to `dispatch` and optionally `ownProps`
- **Object shorthand form**: More declarative and easier to use

> ⭐ **Note:** We recommend using the object form of `mapDispatchToProps` unless you specifically need to customize dispatching behavior in some way.

## Defining `mapDispatchToProps` As A Function

Defining `mapDispatchToProps` as a function gives you the most flexibility in customizing the functions your component receives, and how they dispatch actions.
You gain access to `dispatch` and `ownProps`.
You may use this chance to write customized functions to be called by your connected components.

### Arguments

1. **`dispatch`**
2. **`ownProps` (optional)**

**`dispatch`**

The `mapDispatchToProps` function will be called with `dispatch` as the first argument.
You will normally make use of this by returning new functions that call `dispatch()` inside themselves, and either pass in a plain action object directly or pass in the result of an action creator.

```js
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    // dispatching plain actions
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" }),
    decrement: () => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" }),
    reset: () => dispatch({ type: "RESET" })
  };
};
```

You will also likely want to forward arguments to your action creators:

```js
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    // explicitly forwarding arguments
    onClick: event => dispatch(trackClick(event)),

    // implicitly forwarding arguments
    onReceiveImpressions: (...impressions) =>
      dispatch(trackImpressions(impressions))
  };
};
```

**`ownProps` ( optional )**

If your `mapDispatchToProps` function is declared as taking two parameters, it will be called with `dispatch` as the first parameter and the `props` passed to the connected component as the second parameter, and will be re-invoked whenever the connected component receives new props.

This means, instead of re-binding new `props` to action dispatchers upon component re-rendering, you may do so when your component's `props` change.

```js
// binds on component re-rendering
<button onClick={() => this.props.toggleTodo(this.props.todoId)} />;

// binds on `props` change
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => {
  toggleTodo: () => dispatch(toggleTodo(ownProps.todoId));
};
```

### Return

Your `mapDispatchToProps` function should return a plain object:

- Each field in the object will become a separate prop for your own component, and the value should normally be a function that dispatches an action when called.
- If you use action creators ( as oppose to plain object actions ) inside `dispatch`, it is a convention to simply name the field key the same name as the action creator:

```js
const increment = () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" });
const decrement = () => ({ type: "DECREMENT" });
const reset = () => ({ type: "RESET" });

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    // dispatching actions returned by action creators
    increment: () => dispatch(increment()),
    decrement: () => dispatch(decrement()),
    reset: () => dispatch(reset())
  };
};
```

The return of the `mapDispatchToProps` function will be merged to your connected component as props. You may call them directly to dispatch its action.

```js
function Counter({ count, increment, decrement, reset }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <span>{count}</span>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

(Full code of the Counter example is [in this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/yv6kqo1yw9))

### Defining the `mapDispatchToProps` Function with `bindActionCreators`

Wrapping these functions by hand is tedious, so Redux provides a function to simplify that.

> `bindActionCreators` turns an object whose values are [action creators](https://redux.js.org/glossary#action-creator), into an object with the same keys, but with every action creator wrapped into a [`dispatch`](https://redux.js.org/api/store#dispatch) call so they may be invoked directly. See [Redux Docs on `bindActionCreators`](https://redux.js.org/api/bindactioncreators)

`bindActionCreators` accepts two parameters:

1. A **`function`** (an action creator) or an **`object`** (each field an action creator)
2. `dispatch`

The wrapper functions generated by `bindActionCreators` will automatically forward all of their arguments, so you don't need to do that by hand.

```js
import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";

const increment = () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" });
const decrement = () => ({ type: "DECREMENT" });
const reset = () => ({ type: "RESET" });

// binding an action creator
// returns (...args) => dispatch(increment(...args))
const boundIncrement = bindActionCreators(increment, dispatch);

// binding an object full of action creators
const boundActionCreators = bindActionCreators({ increment, decrement, reset }, dispatch);
// returns
// {
//   increment: (...args) => dispatch(increment(...args)),
//   decrement: (...args) => dispatch(decrement(...args)),
//   reset: (...args) => dispatch(reset(...args)),
// }
```

To use `bindActionCreators` in our `mapDispatchToProps` function:

```js
import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";
// ...

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return bindActionCreators({ increment, decrement, reset }, dispatch);
}

// component receives props.increment, props.decrement, props.reset
connect(
  null,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(Counter);
```

### Manually Injecting `dispatch`

If the `mapDispatchToProps` argument is supplied, the component will no longer receive the default `dispatch`. You may bring it back by adding it manually to the return of your `mapDispatchToProps`, although most of the time you shouldn’t need to do this:

```js
import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";
// ...

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    dispatch,
    ...bindActionCreators({ increment, decrement, reset }, dispatch)
  };
}
```

## Defining `mapDispatchToProps` As An Object

You’ve seen that the setup for dispatching Redux actions in a React component follows a very similar process: define an action creator, wrap it in another function that looks like `(…args) => dispatch(actionCreator(…args))`, and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.

Because this is so common, `connect` supports an “object shorthand” form for the `mapDispatchToProps` argument: if you pass an object full of action creators instead of a function, `connect` will automatically call `bindActionCreators` for you internally.

**We recommend always using the “object shorthand” form of `mapDispatchToProps`, unless you have a specific reason to customize the dispatching behavior.**

Note that:

- Each field of the `mapDispatchToProps` object is assumed to be an action creator
- Your component will no longer receive `dispatch` as a prop

```js
// React-Redux does this for you automatically:
dispatch => bindActionCreators(mapDispatchToProps, dispatch);
```

Therefore, our `mapDispatchToProps` can simply be:

```js
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  increment,
  decrement,
  reset
};
```

Since the actual name of the variable is up to you, you might want to give it a name like `actionCreators`, or even define the object inline in the call to `connect`:

```js
import {increment, decrement, reset} from "./counterActions";

const actionCreators = {
  increment,
  decrement,
  reset
}

export default connect(mapState, actionCreators)(Counter);

// or
export default connect(
  mapState,
  { increment, decrement, reset }
)(Counter);
```

## Common Problems

### Why is my component not receiving `dispatch`?

Also known as

```js
TypeError: this.props.dispatch is not a function
```

This is a common error that happens when you try to call `this.props.dispatch` , but `dispatch` is not injected to your component.

`dispatch` is injected to your component _only_ when:

**1. You do not provide `mapDispatchToProps`**

The default `mapDispatchToProps` is simply `dispatch => ({ dispatch })`. If you do not provide `mapDispatchToProps`, `dispatch` will be provided as mentioned above.

In another words, if you do:

```js
// component receives `dispatch`
connect(mapStateToProps /** no second argument*/)(Component);
```

**2. Your customized `mapDispatchToProps` function return specifically contains `dispatch`**

You may bring back `dispatch` by providing your customized `mapDispatchToProps` function:

```js
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    increment: () => dispatch(increment()),
    decrement: () => dispatch(decrement()),
    reset: () => dispatch(reset()),
    dispatch
  };
};
```

Or alternatively, with `bindActionCreators`:

```js
import { bindActionCreators } from "redux";

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    dispatch,
    ...bindActionCreators({ increment, decrement, reset }, dispatch)
  };
}
```

See [this error in action in Redux’s GitHub issue #255](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/255).

There are discussions regarding whether to provide `dispatch` to your components when you specify `mapDispatchToProps` ( [Dan Abramov’s response to #255](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/255#issuecomment-172089874) ). You may read them for further understanding of the current implementation intention.

### Can I `mapDispatchToProps` without `mapStateToProps` in Redux?

Yes. You can skip the first parameter by passing `undefined` or `null`. Your component will not subscribe to the store, and will still receive the dispatch props defined by `mapStateToProps`.

```js
connect(
  null,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(MyComponent);
```

### Can I call `store.dispatch`?

It's an anti-pattern to interact with the store directly in a React component, whether it's an explicit import of the store or accessing it via context (see the [Redux FAQ entry on store setup](https://redux.js.org/faq/storesetup#can-or-should-i-create-multiple-stores-can-i-import-my-store-directly-and-use-it-in-components-myself) for more details). Let React-Redux’s `connect` handle the access to the store, and use the `dispatch` it passes to the props to dispatch actions.
