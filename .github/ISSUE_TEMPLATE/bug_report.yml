        ======================

        The issue tracker is meant for bug reports only. This isn't the best place for support or usage questions. Questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

        - Read the docs: https://react-redux.js.org/
        - Check out the troubleshooting guide: https://react-redux.js.org/troubleshooting
        - Look for/ask questions on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux
        - Ask in chat: https://www.reactiflux.com/

        Think you found a bug?
        ======================
        The best bug report is a failing test in the repository as a pull request. Otherwise, please use the form below.

        If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
